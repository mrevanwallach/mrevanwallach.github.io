        <p>SimAnt: The Electronic Ant Colony is a 1991 life simulation video game by Maxis and Maxis's third product, focusing on ants. It was designed by Will Wright. In 1992, it was named "Best Simulation Program" at the Software Publishers Association's Codie awards.</p>

        <p>It's now abandonware, and you can play it for free online. Either Google "SimAnt Online" or <a href=https://playclassic.games/game/play-simant-the-electronic-ant-colony-online/play/>click here to an emulation that I think works well</a></p>

        <p><a href="index.html">Go Home!</a> </p>

        <p>And this is one of the changes I'm making so that I can push it to GitHub!</p>
