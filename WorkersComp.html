<p> Whether you run a business with hundreds of employess or you're self-employed and you need a work permit, you're probably required by law to maintain workers compensation.</p>

<p> If and when an employee is injured either on the job or as a result of his/her employment, their employer is almost always liable, per state law, to provide compensation to that worker. Workers Compensation claims are governed by the doctrine of "strict liability" - in laymans terms, that means that the employer is responsible whether or not there was any fault or negligence. Claims range from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, based on the severity of the injury and amount of time the claimant is out of work.</p>

<h5>These expenses include:</h5>

<li>Medical Coverage: doctors visits, hospital care, prescriptions medicine, and a host of other treatments which may be required based on the specific injury.</li>
<li>Disability: partial replacement of an employee's lost income while he or she is unable to work as a result of a work-related injury.</li>
<li>Rehabilitation: ranging from physical therapy to vocational training for workers that can't return to their previous occupation due to the nature of their injury.</li>
<li>Death Benefits: benefits afforded to the spouse and any minor children of a worker who died from a work related injury.</li>
<p></p>

<p>Most employers look at workers' compensation as just another necessary evil and unavoidable cost of doing business. It's usually one of those out of sight, out of mind things when rates are low. It's not until an employer is hit with a claim or a rate hike that they really start to give some thought to their workers' compensation coverage.</p>

<p>Employers need to look at workers' compensation as a tool to improve their business' bottom line, and make an effort to keep their low rates over the long-term so that they can take advantage of some significant savings.</p>

<h3>How we help</h3>
<p></p>
<p class="pppoints">We'll shop around your coverage</p>

<p>BGES has relationships with dozens of insurance companies. Each time we generate a quote, we shop the quote out across our portfolio of providers and select the best coverage at the lowest rate. Employers who work with directly with insurance companies don't have that luxury - either they're taking the price they get from the insurer or doing a ton of the leg work themselves. We solve for both of those problems, and in doing so, often save our clients between 20% and 40%.</p>

<p class="pppoints">We'll find and eliminate fees</p>

<p>When many of our clients come to us initially, there are all kinds of hidden and explicit fees that inflate their total cost of coverage. Some are obnoxious - like 10% "program management" fees or onerous audit costs. And some are subtle and incideous - like your payroll company masking their fees or an insurer failing to notify you when you're not getting all of the credits you're entitled to. As a brokerage, we work for you - not the insurance company. Our incentive is to structure your coverage to avoid those kinds of fees to make you a happy customer.</p>

<p class="pppoints">We'll analyse your classifications</p>

<p>Misclassifications are one of the most common reasons that a policy's premium might inflate. Areas like experience modifiers and payroll classifications are often calculated or noted incorrectly, which means that your insurer will lump you into the highest paying group by defalut. We've been catching mistakes like that for over 20 years, so we know where - and how - to look.</p>
