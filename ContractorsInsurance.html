<p> If you're a contractor, and you want to take on a new project, you'll almost certainly be required by your client to provide a certificate of insurance. No insurance, no project.</p>

<p>They want to make sure that you're covered in case of an accident or a suit by a third party. If a client trips over a toolbox or one of your employees slanders a competitor, you could be on the hook for legal fees, damages, and more - whether or not you're found liable of any wrongdoing.</p>

<!-- https://construction.insureon.com/resources/faq/what-does-general-liability-insurance-cover -->

<p>Generally speaking, this kind of insurance comes in handy when:</p>

<li>Property Damage: your employees damage a client's property, or a neighboring property, intentionally or inadvertently, on the job or off, your contracting company will probably be liable for expenses costs related to restoration</li>
<li>Third Party Injuries: a client trips over an extension cord and fractures their wrist, or slips on a wet floor in a work area, then that could end up being very costly for your company.</li>
<li>Reputational Injuries: a competitor comes after your company for one of a variety of reasons - whether it's because of an ad you ran or something you or an employee said off hand. Those legal battles can become very expensive very quickly.</li>
<li>Work Product Issues: a floorboard on stairs you installed comes loose and someone takes a nasty tumble, or a  </li>

<p></p>

<p>Contractors insurance can be difficult to obtain, especially when you have a history of a loss, and difficult to manage when a claim occurs or an issue pops up. We've helped many clients who thought that the State Fund was their only option, and an expensive one at that, by shopping your quote across over 40 different insurance providers that specialize in coverage for contractors. 

<p>And if an issue does arise, you'll only have to work with one point person - your dedicated BGES rep - to resolve it. There's no bureaucracy, no call waiting music - just help, when you need it, by one consistent, experienced person that's managed the process hundreds of times.</p>
