<p>In SimAnt, the player plays the role of an ant in a colony of black ants in the back yard of a suburban home. The ant colony must battle against enemy red ants. The ultimate goal is to spread throughout the garden, into the house, and finally to drive out the red ants and human owners.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like when you win:</p>

<p>If you follow the instructions outlined in this guide, you won't have to worry about what it looks like when you lose - because you wont!</p>

<h1>Winning real fast</h1>

<p>The objectives of the game are two fold:
    <li>Destroy all of the red ant patches</li>
    <li>Drive the human, dog, and cat out of the house by occupying 70% of the area of the house</li>
</p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>

<img src="Untitled 34.png">

<p>You'll start out as a lone yellow ant. While it may be lonely at the moment, don't worry - you're destined for greatness: you're about to be a queen! Soon, you'll discover the many perils of the yard, first among them being your enemy: the evil red ants!</p>

<p>The first order of business is to dig a nest. If you select the "map" button in the upper right hand corner, you'll see where you are within the plot. You'll notice a cluster of green dots on the map. If you click on it, and whenever you click on the map, it'll give you a view of that piece of the map. This, my newly annointed friend, is food!</p>

<p>You'll want to dig your first nest close enough to the food that it's quick and easy to get there, but not too close. If you're too close, then you make yourself a target for an attack by the red ants. About one window length to the left of the food is a good rule of thumb. If you happen to be near a spider - a predator of ants! - I'd recommend building your nest at least a window length above or below the spider - you don't want to unnecessarily expose your colony to risk as your numbers build.</p>

<p>I'd recommend digging a relatively simple hole with the queen. The longer you dig around, and the longer you go without food, the more that the health decreases - this becomes important in a few minutes. Dig a hole that looks like this</p>

<p>Now, press 2 or click on the ant and select "start brood" and this will happen:</p>

<p>Tada! You've exchanged bodies with a fresh worker ant. The queen will continue to lay eggs while you get to work. First, you should dig around. Dig chambers that look like what you've seen on an ant farm. If your nest is too small, your colony can't expand. Take about 120 seconds to build out something significant - 3 chambers should do, and each of those chambers should be roughly 2x4 spaces (or more) and off the central shaft, for easy access.</p>

<p>Head over to the food, pick up a piece by double clicking on the green pellets, and bring it back to the nest. Make sure to just click once on the nest hole, because that will bring you into the nest. If you double click, you'll drop the food pellet. Bring a few of those pellets inside of the nest. After a minute or two, the eggs will begin to hatch! You have some friends!</p>

<h2>And now the strategy begins</h2>

<p>Instead of bringing food pellets into the nest, place them right next to the nest. The newly minted worker ants will pick them up and bring them into the hole, saving you time. The AI is only so so, so whatever you can do to make it easier for them to do their job at the beginning will make your colony grow faster and more smoothly.</p>

<h1> Your goal at the beginning of the game is to scale your colony as quickly as possible.</h1>

<p>Tips:
<li>Click on Window > Behavior. This menu is how you can control the AI for the CPU ants. Clicking will will bring up this window:

<img src="Untitled 35.png">

<li>Foraging means that your ants will focus on finding food and bringing it back to the nest</li>
<li>Digging means that your ants will focus on expanding your nest. This is important, because you colony can't increase in size if your nest is </li>
<li>Nursing means that ants will move around the eggs in the nest to encourage greater colony growth</li>
</p>

<p>Since you've already dug out a bit of a nest, I'd recommend setting the behavior to 80% foraging and 20% nursing. Your goal at first is to get as much food and grow as quickly as possible - these behaviors will support that</p>

<p>Press 2 in order to rally 10 ants. They'll come and surround you, as well as follow you around. Lead them to the food and press 4 to dismiss all. You'll notice that when you dismiss your army, they'll grab a piece of food and bring it back to the nest. This is a better way to get food than letting the AI try to manage that process. Give them a few seconds to drop off the food, summon the ants again, and release them again. This is the fastest way to collect food.</p>

<p>If you do this, you'll notice that you grow pretty quickly. Makes sense, because you're getting a lot of food. In obtaining the food quickly and efficiently, you're also depriving the red colony of food - you're smarter than the AI. Once you hit about 20 or 30 ants, you can go back into the behavior window and rebalance so that you throw some effort towards digging - give it about 10%, and steal that from the foraging pool.</p>

<h2>Leading an attack</h2>

<p>Once you have about 30 ants, I'd recommend taking out the red colony. The sooner you take it out, the sooner that you can move on to expanding into the yard.</p>

<p>Click on the map, locate the red colony, and guide your ants to the bottom of the plot under that point. You'll want to do this to avoid running into the red ants (your guys will automatically start to fight with them, resulting in casualties on both sides, and this strategy will avoid that consequence.</p>
